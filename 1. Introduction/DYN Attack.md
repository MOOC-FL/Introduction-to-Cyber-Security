**The attack was powered by a massive botnet of Internet of Things (IoT) devices.**

Here's why this made the attack so powerful and notable compared to previous ones:

*   **Unprecedented Scale:** Instead of relying on traditional computers, the attack used a botnet called **Mirai** that consisted of hundreds of thousands of compromised, everyday IoT devices like digital cameras, DVR players, and routers.
*   **Vast Attack Surface:** These devices were poorly secured (with weak default passwords that couldn't be changed), making them easy to infect and recruit. This created a massive, distributed army of attackers that was much larger than botnets made only of computers.
*   **Concentrated Firepower:** The huge number of compromised devices allowed the attackers to generate an immense amount of traffic, overwhelming Dyn's servers and causing widespread outages for major websites like Twitter, Netflix, Reddit, and GitHub.

The other potential options (like a new type of malware or a flaw in the DNS protocol itself) were not the primary, defining reason this specific attack was so powerful. The novel use of a vast IoT botnet was the key differentiator.
